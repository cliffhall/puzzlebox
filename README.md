# puzzlebox
An [MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main) that hosts dynamically configurable [finite state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) for managing agent and team process state.  

## What problem does puzzlebox address?
Marshalling multiple agents toward a big goal is about more than just breaking down a prompt into tasks and enabling collaboration.

A large software project typically moves through a non-linear and occasionally looping path from inception to design to building to testing to documentation to marketing to production. Different teams are focused on different aspects over time, informed by what's gone before and with an eye toward an ever-changing goal that is refined according to lessons learned. 

You can't control all that with just a prompt. 

## What is a Puzzle?
A Puzzle in puzzlebox is a finite state machine. It's just easier to say, write, and think about. 

Imagine the Rubik's Cube puzzle. It has 43 quintillion states, and to move between them, you make twists on the planes of the cube. 

An even more challenging puzzle is how create a non-trivial thing with AI agents, as that thing becomes more complex.

### Properties of a Puzzle
- A finite number of discrete states, e.g., "WriteCode", "UnitTest", "FormatCode", "TypeCheck", "RunLinter".
- Each state may have any number of actions (including 0) that initiate transition to another state.
- There is an initial state.
- There is a current state that may differ after actions have been performed on the puzzle.
- Transitions can be canceled by state exit and enter guards, e.g., Consult LLM via client sampling request.

## What is Puzzlebox

An **MCP Server** implementation that:
  - Manages puzzle instances
  - Exposes tools for: 
    - Adding puzzles
    - Getting a snapshot of the state and available actions for a given puzzle in the box
    - Performing actions on a given puzzle in the box that trigger state transitions

## Simple Example
```json
{
  "initialState": "LOBBY",
  "states": {
    "LOBBY": {
      "name": "LOBBY",
      "actions": {
        "START_GAME": { "name": "START_GAME", "targetState": "PLAYING" }
      }
    },
    "PLAYING":  {
      "name": "PLAYING",
      "actions": {
        "END_GAME": { "name": "END_GAME", "targetState": "GAME_OVER" }
      }
    },
    "GAME_OVER": {
      "name": "GAME_OVER",
      "actions": {
        "RESTART": { "name": "RESTART", "targetState": "PLAYING" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works
1. Clients connect to the SSE server
2. Clients register puzzles with the server for each agent or team
3. Agents perform actions on puzzles 
4. The puzzlebox server ensures that an attempted action is valid for the current state
5. If action is valid, the server initiates a transition to the target state
6. During transition, exit and enter guards send sampling requests to the client, results of which could cancel the transition (think acceptance testing)
7. If guards pass, the state transition completes
8. Clients update their UI based on the new state

## MCP Tools

### **`add_puzzle`**
#### Add a new instance of a puzzle (finite state machine).
- **Inputs:** None
- **Returns:** JSON object with boolean `success` and `puzzleId`

### **`get_puzzle_snapshot`**
#### Get a snapshot of a puzzle (its current state and available actions).
- **Inputs:** `puzzleId`
- **Returns:** JSON object with `currentState` and `availableActions` array

### **`perform_action_on_puzzle`**
#### Perform an action on a puzzle (attempt a state transition).
- **Inputs:** `puzzleId` and `actionName`
- **Returns:** JSON object with `currentState` and `availableActions` array

### **`count_puzzles`**
#### Get the count of registered puzzles
- **Inputs:** None
- **Returns:** JSON object with current `count` of registered puzzles

## Developer Setup

### Install Dependencies

- `cd /path/to/mcp-state-machine/`
- `npm install`

### Build

- `npm run build`
- Builds the stdio-based MCP server runtime at `/dist/index.js`

### Start

- `npm run start`
- Launches an SSE-based/MCP server on port `:3001` with endpoint `/sse`
- This has a single instance of the MCP server which multiple clients can connect to via SSE
- **MUST BE LAUNCHED BEFORE RUNNING INSPECTOR**

### Inspector

- `npm run inspector`
- Runs the [Model Context Protocol Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector)
- The Inspector UI will be available at: http://localhost:5173
- In the Inspector UI:
  - Make sure `Transport Type` is set to `SSE`
  - Make sure `URL` is set to http://localhost:3001/sse
  - Click its **"Connect"** button to connect to the MCP Proxy
    - You should see Green light ðŸŸ¢and **"Connected"** message.
  - Click its **List Tools** button

### Format

- `npm run format`
- Runs `prettier` on the code, adjusting formatting

### Typecheck

- `npm run typecheck`
- Runs `tsc` with args to check and report type issues

### Lint

- `npm run lint`
- Runs `eslint` to non-destructively check for and report syntax problems

### LintFix

- `npm run lint:fix`
- Runs `eslint` to check for and fix syntax problems

### Test

- `npm run test`
- Run the unit tests

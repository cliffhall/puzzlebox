## Coordinating agents with state machines 

An [MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main) that hosts state machines as dynamic resources that clients can subscribe to and be updated when their state changes.

## What problem does puzzlebox address?
Marshalling multiple agents toward a big goal is tougher than just breaking down a request into tasks, assigning them to available agents and enabling collaboration between them. 

Just as a few agents can collaborate to complete a small project, several teams of process-aware agents need to operate within distinct project phases to tackle long horizon efforts.

Consider enterprise-level software development processes:

* A large software project typically moves through a multi-step, occasionally backtracking path from inception to design to building to testing to documentation to marketing to production. 

* Different teams are focused on different aspects over time, informed by what's gone before and with an eye toward an ever-changing goal that is refined according to lessons learned. 

With puzzlebox, members of agentic teams can be made process-aware.

### Scenario: Teams passing the torch

Three agents are working. The current state of their shared puzzle is "Specification". 
* Agent 1 is specifying the domain language.
* Agent 2 is defining project scope.
* Agent 3 is producing the specification document.
* The agents collaborate to reach the final specification document.
* Once the spec is done, Agent 3 initiates a transition to "Design" state.
  * First, the spec is checked by an exit guard (i.e., LLM sampling) for completeness. 
    * If problems are found, the state transition is canceled and the team continues.
    * If acceptable, the state changes to "Design". 
      * The "Specification" agents are monitoring the puzzle and should clock out now. 
        * Their long (and expensive) contexts have been distilled into the specification.
        * The "Design" team picks from here, with the spec as a resource and their contexts fresh and role-specific.

## What is a puzzle?
A Puzzle in puzzlebox is a [finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). It's just easier to say, write, and think about.

Imagine the Rubik's Cube puzzle. It has 43 quintillion states, and to transition between them, you act upon it by rotating the intersecting planes of the mechanism.

### Properties of a puzzle
- A finite number of discrete states, e.g., "Series Concept and Tone", "World Building", "Arc Plotting", "Episode Planning", "Plotline Blending", "Episode Outline", "Script Writing" etc.
- Each state may have any number of actions (including 0) that initiate transition to another state.
- There is an initial state.
- There is a current state that may differ after actions have been performed on the puzzle.
- Transitions can be canceled by state exit and enter guards, e.g., Consult LLM via client sampling request.

## What is puzzlebox?

An **MCP Server** implementation that:
  - Manages puzzle instances
  - Exposes tools for: 
    - Adding puzzles
    - Getting a snapshot of the state and available actions for a given puzzle in the box
    - Performing actions on a given puzzle in the box that trigger state transitions
  - Exposes registered puzzles as resources
    - Clients can use the `Puzzle Snapshot` resource template to fetch the resource by ID
    - Resource URI is `puzzlebox:/puzzle/{puzzleId}`
    - Clients can subscribe/unsubscribe to individual resource URIs
  
## Simple Example
```json
{
  "initialState": "LOBBY",
  "states": {
    "LOBBY": {
      "name": "LOBBY",
      "actions": {
        "START_GAME": { "name": "START_GAME", "targetState": "PLAYING" }
      }
    },
    "PLAYING":  {
      "name": "PLAYING",
      "actions": {
        "END_GAME": { "name": "END_GAME", "targetState": "GAME_OVER" }
      }
    },
    "GAME_OVER": {
      "name": "GAME_OVER",
      "actions": {
        "RESTART": { "name": "RESTART", "targetState": "PLAYING" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works
1. Clients connect to a puzzlebox SSE server.
2. Clients register puzzles with the server.
3. Clients perform actions on puzzles that may change their state and available actions.
4. The puzzlebox server ensures that any attempted action is valid for the current state of the given puzzle.
5. If an action is valid, a transition to the target state is initiated.
6. During transition, optional exit and enter guards may send sampling requests to the client, the results of which could lead to cancellation of the transition (think acceptance testing by stakeholders)
7. If guards pass, the state transition completes.
8. Clients update their UI based on the new state.
9. Clients can subscribe to a given puzzle to receive updates when its state changes.
10. If the client receives a resource updated notification, they can either read the resource or use the `get_puzzle_snapshot` tool to get the current state and available actions.

## MCP Tools

### ‚öôÔ∏è **`add_puzzle`**
#### Add a new instance of a puzzle (finite state machine).
- **Inputs:** None
- **Returns:** JSON object with boolean `success` and `puzzleId`

### ‚öôÔ∏è **`get_puzzle_snapshot`**
#### Get a snapshot of a puzzle (its current state and available actions).
- **Inputs:** `puzzleId`
- **Returns:** JSON object with `currentState` and `availableActions` array
- **Note:** MCP clients that don't support resource subscriptions can poll this tool to watch for state changes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **`perform_action_on_puzzle`**
#### Perform an action on a puzzle (attempt a state transition).
- **Inputs:** `puzzleId` and `actionName`
- **Returns:** JSON object with `currentState` and `availableActions` array

### ‚öôÔ∏è **`count_puzzles`**
#### Get the count of registered puzzles
- **Inputs:** None
- **Returns:** JSON object with current `count` of registered puzzles
